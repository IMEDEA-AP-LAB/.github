## Hi there 👋

The Marine Technology, Operational and Coastal Oceanography (TMOOC) group is interested in the physical mechanisms of the dynamics of the ocean, from the nearshore to the open sea. Research activities within the Group encompass climate and large-scale dynamics,meso and submesoscale variability, wave propagation, coastal processes and turbulence with theoretical, numerical and observational perspectives, including the development of new monitoring strategies. With a predominant background in physics, the group members explore the underlying processes and the interdisciplinary effects of the complex ocean system. The variability of the scales involved, from meters to thousands of kilometres, and from seconds to years, and their nonlinear interactions, makes the understanding of the mechanisms a long-standing challenge.
